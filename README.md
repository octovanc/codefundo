Whenever we think of technology that can alarm everyone when required,the basic idea which comes in our mind is a mobile application as it is the most fundamental and easiest way to spread message to the mass.
So, my idea here is to build a mobile application which is centrally controlled by Nation's Disaster management corporation/NDRF.
Whenever there is a potential  risk of cyclone,flood,heavy rainfall,landslides and other natural calamities,the app will come in action and function primarily in 3 steps:
1>The central server identifies the location and the natural calamity.Using historical(suitable) data analysis,calculate the potential risks in the region and create a request to the subserver whose primary task is to notify the users.so,By this way a user is notified.
Also,Major news or information must be transmitted via SMS as many users may be offline or don't use internet.
2>The second task of the app is to directly make a call to The responsible authorities and warn them to the risks.Also,provide with them the necessary actions to be taken for relief,the intensity of calamity,the population under risk.
3>Store the data recorded from each natural calamity for future use.
-The app should display all the regions which are prone to any natural disaster and send briefs to its users regarding the same.
-The infrastructure of the app should be robust and should be easy to use.
-Application should be multi OS operatable.(Ios/android/Windows)
